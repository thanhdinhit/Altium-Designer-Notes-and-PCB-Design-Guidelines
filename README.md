## Schematics

- Draw circuits from **left to right** and **top to bottom**.
- Draw circuits in functional block and use **Net Labels** for connecting blocks to each other.
- Use **standard designators**:
   - IC: IC or U
   - Resistor: R
   - Capacitor: C
   - Inductor: L
   - Transistor: Q or T
   - Diode/LED: D
   - Crystal: Y/XTAL
   - Pin headers: J
   - Jumper: JP
   - Fuse: F
   - Ferrite Bead: FB
   - Fiducial: FD
   - Test point: TP
- Add the **Cover Page** to the schematic:
   - Project name
   - Date
   - Re/version number
   - All the names of schematics
   - Notes legend
   - Company information
   - Schematic status with date (Draft, Preliminary, Checked, Released)
      - Draft: Blocks, just the structure of the schematic.
      - Preliminary: Connections done, Quiet close to final.
      - Checked: No mistakes in schematic.
      - Released: PCB sent for fab.
- Don't connect 4 wires at one junction.
- Place all labels, designators, pins, text etc. **horizontally**.
- **Don't fill up** the whole sheet.
- Name schematics with **clear** and **short** name.
    - For example: Use CPU_HDMI and CPU_LVDS instead of CPU1 and CPU2.
- Use "**+...V...**" for power nets
    - **Never use "VCC" as net name!**
    - For example: +12V, +5V, +3V3, +2V5, and etc.  
- **Fill information** in Title block.
- Use **distinctly** and **clear** names for schematics.
- Add useful **Design Notes** on the schematic.
- If you suspect that there are parts in the circuit, place them. If you do not need them, you can remove them later!
- **Double check** RX & TX pins.
    - **Never use "TX" & "RX" as net name alone!**
    - For example: Use MCU_TX or GPS_RX instead of TX or RX alone!
- Put enough and useful Test Points (TPs) for circuit debugging.
- Place components in the schematic **close to the pins** where they should be located on PCB.
    - For example: bypass capacitors.
- Generate **PDF** of the completed schematic.

### Stackup
- `Design` > `Layer Stack Manager`

- `PCB Panel` > `<Net Name>` > `Right-Click` > `Display Override > Selected ON`
- Net Color for GND = Blue (236)
- Net Color for PWR = Orange (4) or Pink (1)
- `F5` = Toggle Net Colors

## Placement

- Plan layout first, then placement.
- Start with **BMC (Big, Main and Critical)** components. e.g. MCU and clock devices.
- Place **predefined location** of components and connectors.
- Isolate **analog and digital** power supply sections.
- Place **clock driver** close to clock oscillator.
- **Arrange** components in rows and columns.
- Arrange components with **uniform orientation**, e.g. diodes and polarized capacitors.
- **Indicate polarity** on silk screen.
- Place all components on **top side** of the PCB. On complex and compact designs place **short height** and/or **low thermal dissipation** components go on bottom, never place tall components on the bottom side else it will increase the total height of the PCB.
- Keep 1mm (40mil) **space** between components and 2.5 and/or 3 (100mill and/or 120mil) from component to edge
- Place **bypass capacitors** as close to IC as possible, use combination of 10uF and 100nF, place smaller cap closer to IC.
- Place **connectors** on one edge of the board.
- Place at least four **mounting holes**.
- Make sure **enough space** around mounting holes for screw heads to sit on and try placing big components around PCB.
- Keep more space around **headers/connectors**.
- Place **hot components** on the top side of the PCB.
- Must place **test points** on all power nets and optional critical signals and programming pins if needed.
